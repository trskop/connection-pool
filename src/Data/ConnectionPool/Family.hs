-- Module defines data family of connection pools that is later specialised
-- for various protocols and implementations.
--
-- This module is intended mostly for library writers, for normal usage just
-- import "Data.ConnectionPool" which re-exports 'ConnectionPool' data family.
--
-- Notice that this module doesn't depend on any other internal modules nor any
-- other package then <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base base>. Please,
-- bear this in mind when doing modifications.

-- | Family of connection pools parametrised by transport protocol.
--
-- /Definition changed version 0.1.4/ to be kind polymorphic (only on GHC >=
-- 7.10) and became part of stable API by being moved in to
-- "Data.ConnectionPool.Family" module.

-- To be able to use poly-kinded ConnectionPool data family we need two things
-- (i) poly-kinded Typeable class and (ii) compiler that is capable of deriving
-- Typeable instance for poly-kinded data family. Otherwise we would break
-- backward compatibility by not providing Typeable instance. Both of these
-- work on GHC only on >=7.10.
